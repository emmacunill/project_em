# EDA & Data wrangling

# OVERVIEW

This aim of this project is to clean and format a dataset containing information about shark attacks.
For afterwords, analyze the data to produce visualizations that will either prove or disprove hypotheses. 

# LIBRARIES USED

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Counter
- Re

# HYPOTHESIS

**1. Are sharks getting tired of attacking, or are humans getting more annoying?**

**2. If they're not getting tired, why is that?**

**3.Are men more attaked than women or the contrary?**

# PROCESS FOLLOWED

1. Exploration of the dataset & stating hypothesis.
2. Cleaning of the dataset.
3. Transforming the dataset.
4. Create visuals to prove or dispruve the hypothesis.
5. Explanations of the foundings & conclusions.

# DEVELOPEMENT

**1. Are sharks getting tired of attacking, or are humans getting more annoying?**

As we can see in this plot, the shark attacks have increased in the last century. We can atribute that to different hypothesis. 
1. is that we have more resources to navigate
2. change of weather , although we don't have the data to demonstrate that
3. change on the human life conditions
4. maybe also change in the sense of peril

Let's see the data in another graphic so that we can analize it deeper.

In this graphic we see only the number of attacks from the 1800 to the actual moment.

To be able to give response on which of our 4 hypothesis is true, we still need to analize deeper.

Let's understand why the sharks are not only not getting, tired, but getting fiercer.


**2. If they're not getting tired, why is that?**

Shall we take a look at the activities people were doing when the attackes occurred?

The answer is obviously, YES, WE SHALL!! 

![scatterplot](https://github.com/emmacunill/project_em/blob/main/images/activities.png?raw=true)

From the data we get from the graphic, we can assume that the great mass of the attacks come from lifestyle. 

Let's get more specific and see only data on the activities from the last 50 years.
